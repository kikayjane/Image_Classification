# Image Classification
This project aims to build a neural network that can accurately distinguish between two specific digits, 0 and 1, from the widely-used MNIST dataset.

## Requirements
Colab

## Data
The data used in this project comes from the MNIST dataset, a benchmark dataset in the field of machine learning and computer vision. MNIST stands for Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database and contains a large collection of handwritten digits. Each image is 28x28 pixels, and labeled with the corresponding digit it represents.

## Analysis
To develop a neural network-based image classification algorithm, the following steps were taken:
  1. Load the data and process it
  2. Define the neural network
  3. Train the model
  4. Evaluate the model (test accuracy)
  5. Visualize the results/predictions
The file "image_classification_analysis" contains the coding that performs the analysis, and is linked in the repository.
